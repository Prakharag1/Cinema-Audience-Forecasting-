Cinema Audience Forecasting Challenge

## Overview
In this competition, I was provided with a time-series forecasting problem centered around cinema audience attendance. The data comes from two separate booking platforms:

- **BookNow**: Online booking and aggregation platform  
- **CinePOS**: POS system tracking on-site ticket sales  

The goal is to predict **audience count** and **booking trends** using machine learning.

## Description
Analyze booking trend data to identify theatres with higher audience counts.

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using the competition metric.
